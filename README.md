# ML0101EN-Regression-Project

This repository contains the implementation of a Regression project based on the ML0101EN course module. The primary goal is to build and evaluate robust machine learning models for predicting a continuous target variable.

## üìä Overview

This project focuses on applying various regression techniques to a specific dataset to achieve the lowest possible prediction error (e.g., minimizing MSE or maximizing R-squared).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Python** | Primary Programming Language |
| **Pandas** | Data Manipulation and Analysis |
| **NumPy** | Numerical Computations |
| **Scikit-learn** | Implementation of ML algorithms (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, etc.) |
| **Matplotlib / Seaborn** | Data Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) |
| **[Add Other Libraries Here]** | [Brief Description] |

## üìÇ Project Files

The main implementation, including all steps from EDA to model evaluation, is contained in:

*   `ML0101EN-Regression-Project.ipynb`: The primary project notebook.
*   `[housePrice.csv]`: The specific dataset used for this regression task (Please replace with the actual file name).
